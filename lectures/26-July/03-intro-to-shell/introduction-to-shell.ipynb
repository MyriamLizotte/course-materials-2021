    "- the shell will look for programs in your command in directories defined in the `$PATH` variable\n",

    "- more generally, you edit any variable and also create new variables\n",
    "- to retrieve the value of a variable, we need the `$` character (e.g. `$VAR` vs VAR)\n",
    "- there are two types of variables: \"shell variables\" and \"environment variables\"\n",
    "    - only environment variables get passed to programs you call from the shell\n",
    "    - you can turn a \"shell variable\" into an \"environment variable\" with `export`\n",

    "    - this statement (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`) is called the shebang\n",
    "- shell scripts need to have execution permission to be run. You change file permission with `chmod`\n",
    "- to run a shell script or any command not in the `$PATH`, we specify the path to the command"
