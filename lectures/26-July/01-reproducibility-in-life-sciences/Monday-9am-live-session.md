# Introduction to the course (15mn)

# Introduce the instructors and TAs

# Introduce the students

# Recall the main points of the lecture (20mn)

# Exercise 1 ===============================

## Debate : 

half students will prepare for trying to convince their supervisor that
 "there is no reproducibility crisis in life sciences"  

half students will prepare for trying to convince their supervisor that
"there is a reproducibility crisis in life sciences"  

after 10mn of preparation, 4 students will be randomly chosen to present their arguments in 2mn

The class will vote on who has been most convincing (the most solid arguments)

# Exercise 2 ===============================

## Question : what is the best action students can take for identifying and curbing reproducibility issues 

Collectively, we will create a list of specific actions that students in the course can take to make their research more reproducible. We will form a group of volunteers and organize the arguments into logical sections. If this is successful, we may try to make this a document that could be posted on the web. 

# Exercise 3 ===============================

Search Pubmed for the vocabulary that reflects the reproducibility crisis and see if (and how) the body of literature is growing on the topic
